# CurrencyConverter

I did this simple converter to training my Python skills and learning about global variables and how to call them into a function. So, in this code I insert 2 global variables called dollar and euro, and when I started the function I called and gave them our currently values, and after that, I started to coding the if-else structure and the converter from Brazilian Real.
